# The Statistics of Tufts Confessions

> *On an average day, there are about 60 confessions broadcasted on the Tufts Confessions Facebook page. The page receives about 1132 confessions in a given month and since its creation in 2013, it has posted nearly 25,000 anonymous confessions of Tufts students. Clearly, we have a lot to say. But what are we all talking about and is it important?*

Python scripts used to mine confession text as well as d3 code used to produce interactive visualizations. (pull at your own risk)
